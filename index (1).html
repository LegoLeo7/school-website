<nav> Horace Mann school has everything a school would have a gym, a musical room, art room , and library. Horace Mann school recently switched buildings and now inhabahte a smaller building which makes it difficult for us to fit all the classrooms one procaution is that our principle Mr. Nardelli got to mods for two fith grade classes as there was not enough room before. This also means that our special classes are smaller especially the music room.</nav>
